AE_1.0
Basic AE models, trained twice with different datasplit seeds
All four models are dense

AE_1.1
Basic AE models, trained twice with different datasplit seeds
Three sparse BI models (sparse BA not possible)

AE_2.0
General idea: retrain the 4 AE models, now with ignoring unlinked genes in bi-models
merge_conditions = (1, 30, 50)
BI trained with MSE_masked
No soft links

AE_2.1
General idea: train the 3 bi-models, now with soft links
merge_conditions = (1, 30, 50)
no FC model (covered in AE_2.0)
Soft links and SL loss (not masked)

AE_2.2
General idea: train the 3 bi-models, with randomized edge masks
merge_conditions = (1, 30, 50)
trained with MSE_Masked (unlinked genes remain unlinked)
no soft links
